# Replicating data between databases

Data replication is a method of copying data from one location to another to ensure all users share the same level of information. This can improve reliability, fault-tolerance, or accessibility. Here are some tools that allow for data replication between different databases:

1. **GoldenGate (Oracle)**: GoldenGate is a software product that allows you to replicate, filter, and transform data from one database to another database. With GoldenGate, you can move committed transactions across multiple heterogeneous systems in your enterprise. More details can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/goldengate.html).

2. **Amazon RDS**: Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It supports the replication of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more. More details can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/).

3. **Google Cloud SQL**: Google Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that makes it easy to set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases on Google Cloud Platform. It supports replication for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases. More details can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sql).

4. **Azure SQL Database**: Azure SQL Database is a fully-managed cloud database provided by Microsoft Azure. It supports various types of replication for data synchronization across multiple databases. More details can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/).

5. **SymmetricDS**: SymmetricDS is an open-source software for data replication, with support for one-way and multi-master replication, filtered synchronization, transformation, and more. It supports various databases including MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and more. More details can be found [here](https://www.symmetricds.org/).

6. **Attunity Replicate (now part of Qlik)**: Attunity Replicate is a high-performance data replication and data ingestion software solution.

8. **SharePlex (Quest)**: SharePlex is a data replication and real-time data integration solution. It enables you to replicate Oracle databases quickly, affordably, and with near zero downtime. More details can be found [here](https://www.quest.com/shareplex/).

Remember, the choice of tool will depend on your specific requirements including the type of databases you are using, the scale of data to be replicated, real-time or batch replication, the complexity of your data, and other specific needs of your project. Always make sure to carefully assess your needs and the capabilities of each tool before making a decision.
